## 🎯 What I Work On

**LEO Satellite Routing with Deep RL / h-DQN**  
[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/LEO%20RL-55dim%20h--DQN-blue)](https://github.com/chennielee/2024KICS-Satelite-Downlink-Source-Code)  
- Energy-efficient ground station selection (10+ GS, AoI minimization, queue/energy constraints).  
- Built a DQN-based agent and reward design that converges stably within 10k episodes on NASA-style data.  
- Now extending to a hierarchical DQN (h-DQN) to make decisions more traceable and fault-isolation faster.  
- Paper: *KICS 2025* (oral) · [DBpia](https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE12132784)

**Multimodal & Hybrid Embeddings for RAG**  
- Multimodal RAG with CLIP: aligned text–image embeddings, validated on 15+ real-world use cases.  
- Hybrid embedding + LLM RAG: improved semantic comprehension by ~15%, deployed via Docker+K8s (3× CPU efficiency).  
- Papers: *KSC 2024* (Best Paper, 3rd) · *KICS 2025 GenAI* (3rd)

**Production Agent & ML Systems**  
- Rock15 Inc: MCP-based multi-agent system, GraphRAG pipeline (500+ docs), DSPy-style agents with 96% observability.  
- Q-Click Inc: Hybrid XGBoost/NN recommendation pipeline, CI/CD for fast deployment.

## 🔬 Interests

- Interpretable & reliable reinforcement learning (DQN → h-DQN, multi-agent, sequential decisions)  
- ML systems: observability vs efficiency, MLOps, RAG, agent architectures  
- AI + Systems: taking theory into production under real constraints

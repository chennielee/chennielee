## 🎯 What I Work On

**LEO Satellite Routing with Deep RL / h-DQN**  
[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/LEO%20Downlink%20RL-DQN%E2%86%92h--DQN-blue)](https://github.com/chennielee/2024KICS-Satellite-Downlink-Source-Code) 
- **Problem:** Energy-aware ground station selection (10 stations) for LEO downlink with **AoI (Age of Information)** minimization under **queue capacity** + **distance-based communication energy** constraints.  
- **Method:** Built a **DQN baseline** that trains stably (≈10k episodes) in a **TLE-driven OCO-2 orbit/visibility simulation** (step-level logging: reward/AoI/energy/queue).  
- **Evaluation:** Compared against **visibility-aware Random** and **distance-greedy** baselines; reporting **return + AoI/energy/queue dispersion** (mean±std over N eval episodes).  
- **Next:** Extending to **hierarchical DQN (h-DQN)** to decouple *high-level objective selection* vs *low-level station choice* for more traceable decisions and faster fault isolation.

**Multimodal & Hybrid Embeddings for RAG**  
- __Text-Image Alignment__: Developed a Multimodal RAG pipeline using CLIP-based joint embeddings to bridge semantic gaps between disparate data types.
- __Hybrid Retrieval Strategy__: Combined dense (vector) and sparse embeddings to improve semantic comprehension by ~15%; optimized for production via Docker & K8s.
- __Research Impact__: Evaluated performance across domain-specific datasets, recognized at KSC 2024 (Best Paper) and KICS 2025.

**Production Agent & ML Systems**  
- __Agentic Workflow__: Built MCP-based tool orchestration and ReAct(DSPy) agents with 96%(REGAS) step-level observability (@ Rock15 Inc).
- __Advanced RAG__: Developed GraphRAG pipelines involving KGE model training and structured document indexing (@ Rock15 Inc).
- __MLOps & Rec System__: Deployed hybrid XGBoost/NN recommendation models with automated CI/CD pipelines (@ Q-Click Inc).
